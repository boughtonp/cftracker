About
-----
CFTracker is an open source CFML based application for monitoring and
inspecting CFML engines.  It provides an insight into activity, active
applications and sessions, plus much more.  It can also support monitoring
by logging statistics and providing graphs based on that information.

Updated Includes:
J Harvey - I've included an Application.cfc that has a simple mapping
for CustomTags and to the Included Folder CFExpose for Built in Error and Component Diagnostics.

Also included in root is cfUnitConsole.cfm to Load the interface.
